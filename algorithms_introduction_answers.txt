Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

Making coffee;

ADD coffee to funnel
PLACE funnel inside coffee machine
ADD water to machine tank
SET machine to 'on'
WAIT for coffee pot to fill


Washing dishes;

ADD soap to sponge
Turn on faucet
WHILE water is hot and there are dishes
 Hold dish in one hand
 Hold sponge in other hand
 Clean dish
 Rinse dish
 Place dish in rack
END WHILE


Making toast;

PLACE bread in toaster
SET toaster to 'on'
WAIT for bread to brown
REMOVE bread
PLACE butter on bread
SPREAD butter using knife


As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem.
It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies
who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It
doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's
algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your
cases make them stand out?

eBay stands out as the first, major platform for online auctioning. The algorithms for bidding,
ease of use, and widespread use revolutionized the way buying and selling could be done online.
Roomba's algorithm solves the problem of self-cleaning. It was the first of its kind of product,
a robotic vacuum that runs automatically. Blue Apron is a popular food kit subscription. Their
algorithm for cooking dinner is what makes them successful. They provide everything needed to
create a meal including instructions, all sent to the consumers house.



Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

An algorithm should follow a sequence of logical steps; it should accomplish a goal, and
execute it in an allotted amount of time. An inefficient algorithm would deviate from
these requirements. The steps might not be set in a logical manner. Or the amount of
time that it takes to complete might not be efficient.
