1.What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

Using a search to find employee salary in a list of unsorted employee salary data.

2.What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

Using a search to find contacts in a phone list whose names start with the letter 'b'.

3.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would
it take to find the value G using linear search?

4.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would
it take to find the value G using binary search?

5.Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between
linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Binary searches only work on sorted collections. So in this case, only linear search would work.

6.Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear
search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A binary search. It is more efficient, with time complexity of O(log n). A linear search would
need to iterate a million times in the worst case scenario. The binary search cuts the search
in half by finding a middle value for comparison.

7.You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest.
Write a program to allow you to win the bet.


function binarySearch(arr, word) {

  let low = 0;
  let high = arr.length;

  while(low <= high) {
    let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);

    if (arr[mid] > word) {
      high = mid - 1;
    } else if (arr[mid] < word) {
      low = mid + 1;
    } else {
      return mid;
    }
  }
  return 'mid not found';
}


8.You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank.
Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

function linearSearch(tank) {

  let nettedfish = '';

  for(let i = 0; i < tank.length; i++) {
    if (tank[i] === 'goldfish') {
      nettedfish = tank[i];
    }
  }

  return nettedfish;

}

let tank = ['redfish', 'bluefish', 'yellowfish', 'goldfish'];

console.log(linearSearch(tank));
