1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?


1. Programmers use pseudocode as a way to brainstorm and organize code. It provides
structure on how the code should look and be written. It helps the process
of writing algorithms.

2. Pseudocode is meant for human consumption, so the computer would not process it
and it would not run.


1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.


1. INPUT first number
   INPUT second number
   IF first number is greater than second number THEN
      PRINT first number
   ELSE
      PRINT second number
   END IF


2. INIT number to 1
   FOR each number of 1 to 100
      PRINT number
   END FOR


3. SET specificEntry to 'John Smith'
   SET phoneBook equal to array of entries
   FOR each entry in phoneBook
      IF entry is equal to specificEntry
         DISPLAY entry THEN
         RETURN entry
      ELSE
         DISPLAY "still searching"
      END IF
   END FOR


4. var specificEntry = 'John Smith';
   var phoneBook = ['Alan Grimm', 'Louise Hay', 'Arnold Brees', 'Jim Fell'];
   for (var i = 0; i < phoneBook.length; i++) {
      if (specificEntry === phoneBook[i]) {
         console.log( "You have found" + phoneBook[i] )
         return phoneBook[i];
      } else {
         console.log( "Still searching...")
      }
   }
